# Purpose: 
- use insurance dataset to train different classification regression models from MLlib.
- use trained model to identify which ones have a better performance.
		 
# Requirements: 
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a linear regression models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
- demonstrate different approaches using MLlib libraries.
